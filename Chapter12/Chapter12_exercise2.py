"""
1. Write a program that reads a word list from a file (see “Reading Word Lists”) and
prints all the sets of words that are anagrams.
Here is an example of what the output might look like:
['deltas', 'desalt', 'lasted', 'salted', 'slated', 'staled']
['retainers', 'ternaries']
['generating', 'greatening']
['resmelts', 'smelters', 'termless']
Hint: you might want to build a dictionary that maps from a collection of letters to a
list of words that can be spelled with those letters. The question is, how can you
represent the collection of letters in a way that can be used as a key?
2. Modify the previous program so that it prints the longest list of anagrams first,
followed by the second longest, and so on.
3. In Scrabble, a “bingo” is when you play all seven tiles in your rack, along with a
letter on the board, to form an eight-letter word. What collection of eight letters
forms the most possible bingos? Hint: there are seven.
