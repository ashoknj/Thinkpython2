"""
The greatest common divisor (GCD) of a and b is the largest number that divides both of
them with no remainder.
One way to find the GCD of two numbers is based on the observation that if r is the
remainder when a is divided by b, then . As a base case, we
can use .
Write a function called gcd that takes parameters a and b and returns their greatest
common divisor.

Interpretation of Computer Programs (MIT Press, 1996).
