"""
Write a function that reads the words in words.txt and stores them as keys in a dictionary.
It doesnâ€™t matter what the values are. Then you can use the in operator as a fast way to
check whether a string is in the dictionary.
If you did Exercise 10-10, you can compare the speed of this implementation with the list
in operator and the bisection search.
